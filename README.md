LearningToolbox
===============

The current version of the Learning Toolbox works with the Metronic reponsive template version 2.0.2.

You need to copy the following assets from the folder ```metronic_v2.0.2\admin\template\assets``` to the Netbeans project:
   - All files from ```css``` to ```Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\css```
   - All files from ```img``` to ```Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\img```
   - All files from ```scripts``` to ```Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\scripts```

Make sure to set the directories ```Files\assets\css```,  ```Files\assets\img```, and ```Files\assets\scripts``` (including all the copied content) to 'ignore' so that the assets aren't uploaded to the 
GitHub repository. We don't want to have material there that cannot be re-distibuted!
