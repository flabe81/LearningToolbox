LearningToolbox
===============

The current version of the Learning Toolbox works with the Metronic reponsive template version 2.0.2.

You need to copy the following assets from the folder metronic_v2.0.2\admin\template\assets to the Netbeans project:
   - All files from 'css' to 'Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\css'
   - All files from 'img' to 'Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\img'
   - All files from 'scripts' to 'Learning Toolbox\Source Files\assets\scripts'
   - The following files and folders from 'plugins'
      - bootstrap
      - bootstrap-hover-dropdown
      - font-awesome
      - jquery-slimscroll
      - jquery-ui
      - jquery-validation
      - select2
      - uniform
      - jquery-1.10.2.min.js
      - jquery-1.10.2.min.map
      - jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js
      - jquery.blockui.min.js
      - jquery.cokie.min.js

Make sure to set the directories to 'ignore' so that the assets aren't uploaded to the 
GitHub repository. We don't want to have material there that cannot be re-distibuted!
